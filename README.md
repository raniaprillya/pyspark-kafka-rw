📡 Kafka to ClickHouse Real-Time Streaming with PySpark
This PySpark application performs real-time streaming from Apache Kafka to ClickHouse, enabling scalable ingestion and processing of event-driven data pipelines.

🚀 Features
✅ Reads streaming data from a Kafka topic using Spark Structured Streaming

✅ Parses and transforms JSON records (customizable)

✅ Writes processed data directly into ClickHouse via JDBC

✅ Supports high-throughput, low-latency ingestion workflows

✅ Designed for real-time analytics, monitoring, or ETL pipelines

⚙️ Technologies Used
Apache Kafka

Apache Spark (Structured Streaming)

ClickHouse (columnar OLAP DB)

PySpark (Python interface for Spark)

🛠️ Prerequisites
Kafka broker running and accessible

ClickHouse server set up with target table(s)

ClickHouse JDBC driver included in Spark classpath

Spark 3.x and Python 3.x

📈 How It Works
Kafka Producer sends events to a topic (e.g., JSON records).

PySpark reads from the topic using the Kafka source.

Data is optionally transformed or filtered.

Spark writes streaming batches to ClickHouse via JDBC sink using foreachBatch.
